The zip file should contain the following:

* Fully commented source code
* An ant build.xml file. There must be an ant target for producing documentation using javadoc
* A readme file that contains instructions for compiling and running the program as well as a detailed explanation of who coded what parts of the program.
* The manager and programmer summaries

One submission per group will be sufficient.

##Grading
* Ten percent of the grade is determined by how well documented the project is (all interfaces, classes, fields, constructors, methods and parameters must be documented).
* Another ten percent of the grade is determined by how well the effort is divided between the group members.
